I am currently finishing a double degree in applied mathematics and computer engineering at ITAM, and finishing my thesis on liquid brains, I was born and raised in Xalapa Veracruz. I like information processing, whether it is with my brain or in other computers.

I have professional experience working with NLP in sentence classification with CNN's and language embeddings and I have done news information extraction with text vectorizers to inform portfolio allocation strategies. I have worked in other Machine learning areas designing recommender systems and other data science tasks.

Currently doing social work at (DataLabITAM)[http://datalabitam.com/].
